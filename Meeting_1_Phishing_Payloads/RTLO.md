The RTLO character stands for Right-To-Left Override. It is a non-printing Unicode character, represented by the Unicode character code U+202E1. This character is used to write languages that are read in the right-to-left manner, such as Hebrew, Arabic, Aramaic, and Urdu2. It takes the input and literally just flips the text the other way round2.

The RTLO character can be used to reverse the display of text that follows it. For example, a Windows screensaver executable named March 25 \u202Excod.scr will display as March 25 rcs.docx. Adversaries may abuse the RTLO character as a means of tricking a user into executing what they think is a benign file type.
