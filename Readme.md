### Event Format
+ Wednesdays 6-8pm
+ An announcements will be made in [Discord](https://discord.gg/dQ49k7fufk) server's announcements channel during the morning of the event. This occurs somewhere between 9-11am.
+ An announcement will be made the week before a meeting so it is not a surprise.
<!-- + I am not going to link to #whereis-cyberrange in the announcement as it appears right next to the announcements channel and should be intuitive enough -->
+ A UML CS Email list announcements will be made big events

This will be formatted like the following: 
```
Hello @everyone
