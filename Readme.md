# Introduction
This repository is the meeting plans & notes for the cyber security club meetings. 

I will make it public once the meetings start.

Please feel free to edit and improve the documents.

## UML Club Resources
+ Discord Server
+ Gmail account
+ Domain umlcyber.club

### Event Format
+ Wednesdays 6-8pm
+ Make announcements in the morning of the event. Like 9-11am
+ Make an announcement the week before the first meeting so it is not a surprise
+ I am not going to link to #whereis-cyberrange in the announcement as it appears right next to the announcements channel and should be intuitive enough
+ Make UML CS Email list announcements for big events

Format like:

Hello @everyone

This weeks meeting will be **6pm Wednesday April 19 in the Cyber Range**
